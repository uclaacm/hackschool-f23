# Hackschool Fall 2023

## Navigating the repository

Hello!

There are a couple different ways to explore this repository. To start, feel free to click around through all the folders and files if you're looking for something specific.

To get the repository onto your local machine, open the terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to the folder you would like to store this folder on. If you don't know how to do that, check out the session 2 slides, google "terminal navigation", or check out this link: https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html.

Once you are at the directory you'd like the folder to be located in, run:
`git clone https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f23.git` in your terminal.

This should create the folder locally and then you're free to check out specific sessions' demos.

To run one specifically, especially for the React demos, you'll likely want to use the terminal to navigate into the specific folder you're curious about-- for example, `cd Session-2` before running `npm run dev`.

It's also recommended to view projects in VSCode for the best dev experience, so you can go through files and see how stuff connects.

As always, if you have any questions feel free to ask in our Discord or to message any of our officers. We're happy to help! Thanks and happy coding!

:)
